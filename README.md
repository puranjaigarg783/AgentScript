# Shimmer Platform MVP - Architecture & Build Plan

## Executive Summary

Shimmer transforms the way professionals create, share, and monetize AI-powered workflows. Unlike static portfolio sites where you can only view someone's work, Shimmer makes workflows interactive—you can talk to them, understand them, modify them, and make them your own.

Imagine GitHub meets Behance, powered by AI agents that explain and adapt workflows in real-time. Our 10-week MVP will demonstrate this revolutionary approach to workflow automation, focusing on immediate value delivery while building a foundation for exponential growth.

**Key Innovation**: AgentScript—our proprietary language that enables AI agents to truly understand workflows, not just execute them. This allows any workflow to become a teacher, consultant, and collaborator.

## The Problem We're Solving

Current workflow platforms fail creators and users in fundamental ways:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Current Reality"
        A[Static Portfolios] --> B[No Interaction]
        C[Complex Workflows] --> D[No Understanding]
        E[Great Ideas] --> F[No Monetization]
        G[Platform Lock-in] --> H[No Portability]
    end
    
    subgraph "Shimmer Solution"
        B --> I[AI-Powered Conversations]
        D --> J[Real-time Explanations]
        F --> K[Multiple Revenue Streams]
        H --> L[Universal Compatibility]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ff6b6b
    style C fill:#ff6b6b
    style E fill:#ff6b6b
    style G fill:#ff6b6b
    style I fill:#51cf66
    style J fill:#51cf66
    style K fill:#51cf66
    style L fill:#51cf66
```

Consider this scenario: A developer creates an amazing customer onboarding workflow. Today, they can only share screenshots or videos. With Shimmer, visitors can:
- Ask the workflow how it handles edge cases
- Fork it and adapt it for their industry
- Get step-by-step guidance while building
- Pay for personalized consultations

## Platform Architecture Overview

Our architecture consists of three main layers working in harmony:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Interface Layer"
        A[Web App] --> B[Visual Workflow Editor]
        A --> C[Chat Interface]
        A --> D[Marketplace]
    end
    
    subgraph "Intelligence Layer"
        E[AgentScript Engine] --> F[Workflow Parser]
        E --> G[AI Agent System]
        E --> H[Transformation Engine]
        I[RAG Knowledge Base] --> G
        J[LLM Integration] --> G
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        K[Workflow Storage] --> L[PostgreSQL]
        M[Execution State] --> N[Redis]
        O[User Analytics] --> P[ClickHouse]
        Q[Vector Store] --> R[Pinecone]
    end
    
    A --> E
    E --> K
    G --> I
    G --> J
    
    style E fill:#ffd43b,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style G fill:#74c0fc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

## AgentScript: The Heart of Shimmer

AgentScript is our domain-specific language that makes workflows truly intelligent. Think of it as the difference between a recipe card (traditional workflow) and having a master chef explain each step as you cook (AgentScript-powered workflow).

### How AgentScript Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AI Agent
    participant AgentScript Engine
    participant Workflow
    
    User->>AI Agent: "How does this email validation work?"
    AI Agent->>AgentScript Engine: Parse workflow context
    AgentScript Engine->>Workflow: Extract validation logic
    Workflow-->>AgentScript Engine: Return step details
    AgentScript Engine-->>AI Agent: Structured understanding
    AI Agent-->>User: "It checks for @ symbol and valid domain..."
    
    User->>AI Agent: "Can we add phone validation too?"
    AI Agent->>AgentScript Engine: Generate modification
    AgentScript Engine->>Workflow: Insert new validation step
    AI Agent-->>User: "I've added phone validation. Here's how it works..."
```

### AgentScript Syntax Example

AgentScript is designed to be readable by humans and AI alike:

```yaml
workflow: "Customer Onboarding"
version: "1.0"
creator: "@sarah_martinez"

steps:
  - id: collect_info
    type: form
    agent_hint: "Gathers essential customer data for account creation"
    fields:
      - name: email
        type: string
        validation: email_format
        required: true
        agent_hint: "Primary communication channel"
      
  - id: verify_email
    type: verification
    agent_hint: "Ensures email ownership before account activation"
    method: send_code
    timeout: 15_minutes
    on_success: create_account
    on_failure: retry_or_support
    
  - id: create_account
    type: database_operation
    agent_hint: "Establishes user profile in our system"
    operation: insert
    table: customers
    data:
      email: ${steps.collect_info.fields.email}
      verified: true
      created_at: ${now()}
```

The `agent_hint` annotations are what make AgentScript special—they give AI agents the context needed to explain, modify, and improve workflows intelligently.

## MVP Features (10 Weeks)

Our MVP focuses on demonstrating core value while building a solid foundation:

```mermaid

    style A fill:#ff6b6b
    style E fill:#4ecdc4
    style I fill:#45b7d1
    style M fill:#96ceb4
```

### Core User Journeys

**Journey 1: The Learner**
Sarah, a marketing manager, discovers a social media automation workflow. She doesn't understand the API integration step. She asks the AI agent, which explains it using her existing WordPress knowledge as a reference point. She modifies the workflow for her company's needs with AI guidance.

**Journey 2: The Builder**
Alex, a developer, finds a payment processing workflow. He forks it, and the AI helps him adapt it from Stripe to PayPal, explaining the differences and handling edge cases. What would take days now takes hours.

**Journey 3: The Creator**
Maria shares her data analysis workflow. Users interact with it 500 times, generating questions that help her create a paid course. She earns revenue from workflow licenses, consultations, and educational content.

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

We begin by building the core infrastructure that everything else depends on:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Core Components"
        A[AgentScript Parser] --> B[AST Generator]
        B --> C[Workflow Engine]
        C --> D[State Manager]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Systems"
        E[PostgreSQL Setup] --> F[Schema Design]
        G[Redis Configuration] --> H[Session Management]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Framework"
        I[FastAPI Server] --> J[WebSocket Support]
        K[Authentication] --> L[JWT Tokens]
    end
```

**AgentScript Parser Development**
The parser is our foundation. We'll implement it using TypeScript and Chevrotain for robust grammar handling. The parser must handle basic workflow structures, validate syntax, and generate meaningful error messages that AI agents can explain to users.

**Workflow Engine Architecture**
Our workflow engine executes AgentScript with these key capabilities:
- Step-by-step execution with state preservation
- Rollback capabilities for error recovery
- Hook system for AI agent observations
- Performance monitoring for optimization insights

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 4-6)

This phase brings workflows to life with AI capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "AI Components"
        A[LLM Abstraction Layer] --> B[OpenAI GPT-4]
        A --> C[Anthropic Claude]
        A --> D[Local Models]
        
        E[Prompt Engineering] --> F[Workflow Context]
        E --> G[User Intent]
        E --> H[Response Generation]
        
        I[RAG System] --> J[Embedding Service]
        I --> K[Vector Search]
        I --> L[Context Retrieval]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Points"
        M[Chat Interface] --> A
        N[Workflow Modifications] --> A
        O[Explanations] --> A
    end
    
    F --> M
    G --> N
    H --> O
```

**Intelligent Workflow Interaction**
We implement a chat interface where users can have natural conversations with workflows. The AI understands workflow context, user intent, and can provide helpful explanations or suggest modifications. This isn't just a chatbot—it's an AI that truly comprehends the workflow's purpose and mechanics.

**RAG System Foundation**
Even in the MVP, we establish a basic RAG system that stores successful interactions, common questions, and workflow patterns. This immediately improves response quality and lays groundwork for future learning capabilities.

### Phase 3: Core Features (Weeks 7-9)

With the foundation and AI in place, we build the features users will love:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Features"
        A[Fork System] --> B[Version Control]
        C[Visual Editor] --> D[Drag & Drop]
        E[Search] --> F[Semantic Matching]
    end
    
    subgraph "Platform Integration"
        G[n8n Importer] --> H[JSON Parser]
        H --> I[AgentScript Converter]
        I --> J[Validation Layer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Creator Tools"
        K[Analytics Dashboard] --> L[Interaction Metrics]
        M[Profile System] --> N[Showcase Page]
    end
```

**Fork and Remix Workflow**
Users can fork any public workflow with one click. The system creates a copy, preserves attribution, and allows modifications. The AI agent understands both the original and forked versions, helping users adapt workflows to their needs.

**Platform Import System**
We start with n8n import as proof of concept. The hybrid transformation system (deterministic parsing + LLM enhancement) converts n8n JSON to clean AgentScript, making workflows more understandable and modifiable.

### Phase 4: Polish and Launch (Week 10)

The final week focuses on reliability and user experience:

- Performance optimization (sub-2s workflow loads)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Demo workflows showcasing platform capabilities
- Documentation for both users and developers
- Load testing and security audit

## MVP System Architecture

Here's how all components work together in our MVP:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Frontend"
        A[React SPA] --> B[Workflow Visualizer]
        A --> C[Chat Component]
        A --> D[Editor Interface]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        E[API Gateway] --> F[Auth Service]
        E --> G[Workflow Service]
        E --> H[AI Service]
        E --> I[Search Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "AI Infrastructure"
        J[LLM Router] --> K[GPT-4]
        J --> L[Claude]
        M[RAG Pipeline] --> N[Embeddings]
        M --> O[Vector DB]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Stores"
        P[(PostgreSQL)] --> Q[Workflows]
        P --> R[Users]
        S[(Redis)] --> T[Sessions]
        S --> U[Cache]
        V[(S3)] --> W[Assets]
    end
    
    A --> E
    G --> J
    H --> M
    I --> O
    G --> P
    F --> S
    
    style A fill:#61dafb
    style E fill:#68d391
    style J fill:#fbbf24
    style P fill:#3b82f6
```

## Workflow Transformation Engine

One of our key innovations is the ability to import workflows from other platforms:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Import Process"
        A[Platform Workflow] --> B[Format Detection]
        B --> C[Deterministic Parser]
        C --> D[Structure Extraction]
    end
    
    subgraph "Transformation"
        D --> E[Pattern Matching]
        E --> F[LLM Enhancement]
        F --> G[AgentScript Generation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Validation"
        G --> H[Syntax Check]
        H --> I[Semantic Validation]
        I --> J[AI Review]
    end
    
    subgraph "Output"
        J --> K[Clean AgentScript]
        K --> L[Agent Hints Added]
        L --> M[Ready for Use]
    end
    
    style F fill:#8b5cf6
    style J fill:#10b981
```

The transformation engine uses a hybrid approach:

1. **Deterministic Parsing** handles 80% of common patterns reliably
2. **LLM Enhancement** interprets complex logic and adds helpful context
3. **Validation Loop** ensures correctness and readability
4. **AI Annotation** adds agent hints for better explanations

### Architecture Principles

**Modularity**: Every component is designed as a standalone module that can be enhanced without affecting others. This allows parallel development and easier testing.

**Scalability**: Even in MVP, we design for scale. Database schemas support sharding, API design allows horizontal scaling, and AI interactions are asynchronous.

**Extensibility**: The plugin architecture allows adding new workflow platforms, AI models, and features without core changes. AgentScript itself is designed to evolve.

**User-Centric**: Every technical decision prioritizes user experience. If it doesn't make workflows easier to understand or use, we don't build it.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**LLM Reliability**: We implement fallback strategies, response validation, and graceful degradation. If AI fails, workflows still function.

**Performance at Scale**: Careful database indexing, intelligent caching, and async processing ensure responsive experience even with growth.

**Platform Changes**: Abstract interfaces for external platforms mean we can adapt quickly to API changes.

### Business Risks

**User Adoption**: Demo workflows and clear onboarding reduce friction. AI assistance makes complex features accessible.

**Creator Monetization**: Start simple with tip jar and consultation bookings, expand based on user feedback.

**Competition**: Our AI-first approach and AgentScript create a moat that's hard to replicate quickly.
